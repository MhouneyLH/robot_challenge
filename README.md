## üìë About the project

This is a simulation-environment of the challenge of [ScienceCamp Jena 2023](https://www.eah-jena.de/science-camp). The Camp was about optimization and robotics and one part of the challenge was to program a robot to find the maximum in a given environment.

Currently the following optimization-algorithms are implemented:

- Downhill-Simplex
